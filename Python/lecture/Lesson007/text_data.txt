The United Kingdom is an advanced European island country. It is surrounded by three bodies of water: the North Sea, in the eastern part,the English Channel in the southern part, and the Atlantic Ocean in the west. 
The country consists of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. 
The term “United Kingdom” is often confused with the term “Great Britain”, which is the name of the island, but not the state. Many smaller islands and adjacent territories form an integral part of this country, as well as the 
area of Northern Ireland in the northwest. The total area of the country is 242,500 sq. km. 
The population is over 67 million people, according to the 2020 statistical data.
The British landscape is diverse. It includes flat countryside, low hills, 
and a long line of high mountains. In this unique island country, the climate is rather mild 
and a bit humid. This geographical region is known for its warm weather in winter, and cool 
weather in summer, combined with intense rainfall and baffling winds over the year.
